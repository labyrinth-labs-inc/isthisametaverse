# Is this a Metaverse?

## Matthew Ball's Metaverse definition

In his book [Metaverse](https://www.amazon.com/Metaverse-How-Will-Revolutionize-Everything/dp/1324092033/), [Matthew Ball](https://www.matthewball.vc/) offers an authoritative and well reasoned definition of what constitutes Metaverses, their key components, what differentiates them from games or multiplayer experiences, and the main challenges we still need to conquer in order to see an actual fully realized Metaverse come to life.

[This article](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse) Matthew's thesis and defines Metaverse as any 3D experience composed of one or many worlds that ticks 7 boxes. From the article:

1. **Be persistent** – which is to say, it never “resets” or “pauses” or “ends”, it just continues indefinitely
2. **Be synchronous and live** – even though pre-scheduled and self-contained events will happen, just as they do in “real life”, the Metaverse will be a living experience that exists consistently for everyone and in real-time
3. **Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of “presence”** – everyone can be a part of the Metaverse and participate in a specific event/place/activity together, at the same time and with individual agency
4. **Be a fully functioning economy** – individuals and businesses will be able to create, own, invest, sell, and be rewarded for an incredibly wide range of “work” that produces “value” that is recognized by others
5. **Be an experience that spans** both the digital and physical worlds, private and public networks/experiences, and open and closed platforms
6. **Offer unprecedented interoperability** of data, digital items/assets, content, and so on across each of these experiences – your *Counter-Strike* gun skin, for example, could also be used to decorate a gun in *Fortnite*, or be gifted to a friend on/through Facebook. Similarly, a car designed for *Rocket League* (or even for Porsche’s website) could be brought over to work in *Roblox.* Today, the digital world basically acts as though it were a mall where every store used its own currency, required proprietary ID cards, had proprietary units of measurement for things like shoes or calories, and different dress codes, etc.
7. Be populated by “content” and “experiences” **created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors**, some of whom are independent individuals, while others might be informally organized groups or commercially-focused enterprises


## A non-exhaustive list of definitely-not-Metaverses

To the best of our knowledge, there isn't currently an app or platform that fits the full definition stated above. The table below includes some of the experiences most commonly described as Metaverses. Green denotes an app matches that the given requirements, red means it doesn't, yellow means partially or to some extent. Notice also that some of the definitions are vague and somewhat open to interpretation, in particular points 3 and 5 of Matt's definition.
